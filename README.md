### NEXT JS Portfolio Website With Tailwind CSS
In this project, I have created a modern and dynamic portfolio website using Next.js and enhanced the design with Tailwind CSS. This portfolio showcases my skills and accomplishments while also serving as a testament to my ongoing journey of learning and improvement.  

**Next.js Framework**
- To create a highly optimized and responsive web application, I chose Next.js as the foundation. Next.js is renowned for its server-side rendering capabilities, but for this particular project, I focused on its other advantages such as client-side rendering and its built-in routing system.


**Tailwind CSS Styling**
- The website's aesthetics are powered by Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development with pre-defined classes that make styling efficient and consistent. The result is a visually appealing and responsive design that enhances the user experience.
